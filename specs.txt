Program Idea: Auto-Generate cooking schedule

Bucket = cooking role 
	* Cooking buckets: Monday-Thursday, Study Break
	* Non-cooking buckets: Kitchen Monster, Lounge Monster, Staples

Restrictions:
	* Each person must be in exactly 1 bucket
	* Each "bucket" must have n people
		* Cooking: 4 people (2 per week)
		* Staples bucket: 2+ people
		* Kitchen Monster: 1 <= num <= Staples
		* Lounge Monster: 1
	* Each person cannot be in certain buckets 
		* can't cook that day
		* New members must cook, can't be in non-cooking buckets
	* 2 people must be in the same cooking bucket (must be cooking partners)
	* 2 cooking noobs can't be in same cooking bucket

Optimizations:
	* Seniority
		* Non-cooking buckets should be assigned based on seniority
	* Schedule preference
		* Try not to put people in "bad" buckets (they'll have to show up late to cook)

Rescheduling:
	Given current schedule and new restrictions/optimizations, minimize the number of switches
